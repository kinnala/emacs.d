* My Emacs configuration

I have a very simple Emacs configuration consisting of a single init.el and a
single private file with some work-related hardcoded paths that are unimportant
for the general public. Some highlights:

- straight.el as a package manager
- consists mainly of use-package macros
- used for my Python development needs
