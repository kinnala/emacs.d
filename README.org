* My Emacs configuration

[[https://github.com/kinnala/emacs.d/blob/master/screenshot.png?raw=true]]

I have a very simple Emacs configuration consisting of a single =init.el= and
another private file with some work-related hardcoded paths that are unimportant
for the general public. Some highlights:

- using Nix as a package manager
- consists mainly of use-package macros
- used for Python development and random hacking

* Installation

Create symbolic links of =init.el= and =emacs.nix= to
=$HOME/.config/nixpkgs/overlays= and run
#+begin_src sh
nix-env -iA nixpkgs.emacs
#+end_src
