* My Emacs configuration

[[https://github.com/kinnala/emacs.d/blob/master/screenshot.png?raw=true]]

I have a very simple Emacs configuration consisting of a single =init.el= and
another private file with some work-related hardcoded paths that are unimportant
for the general public. Some highlights:

- straight.el as a package manager
- consists mainly of use-package macros
- used for Python development and random hacking

* Installation

Copy =init.el= to =~/.emacs.d/init.el= and restart Emacs.  Some of the
configured paths (e.g. =org= and =virtualenvwrapper=) won't make sense in your
system so you have to modify them.
